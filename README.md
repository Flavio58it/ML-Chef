## Multiclass Classification using Keras and TensorFlow on Grocery Dataset
### What's for dinner?


### Project Description
Overview:

- Understand Grocery Dataset structure and files
- Visualize random image from each of the food classes
- Split the image data into train and test using train.txt and test.txt
- Create a subset of data with few classes(3) - train_mini and test_mini for experimenting
- Fine tune Inception Pretrained model using dataset
- Visualize accuracy and loss plots
- Predicting classes for new images from internet
- Scale up and fine tune Inceptionv3 model with 10 classes of data
